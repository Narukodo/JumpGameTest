# JumpGameTest
Unity experimentation
This is a game where the player attempts to land on as many platforms as possible while collecting points.

Trying out:
- Swapping prefabs
- Spawning random prefabs
- Jump mechanics

## Getting Started
Feel free to clone the repo and start playing.

## Upcoming features
- More points
- Platforms spawn in more randomized locations
- Blocker platforms
- Points will be displayed soon
